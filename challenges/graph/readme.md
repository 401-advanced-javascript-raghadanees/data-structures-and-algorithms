## Graphs
Data structure consists of a finite set of vertices (also called nodes or points), together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a directed graph. 
These pairs are known as edges (also called links or lines), and for a directed graph are also known as arrows. 
The vertices may be part of the graph structure, or may be external entities represented by integer indices or references.

## challenge 
Implement Graph. The graph should be represented as an adjacency list, and should include the following methods:
- AddNode()
Adds a new node to the graph Takes in the value of that node Returns the added node 
- AddEdge()
Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph Include the ability to have a “weight” Takes in the two nodes to be connected by the edge Both nodes should already be in the Graph
- GetNodes()
Returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection (set, list, or similar)
- GetNeibors()
Returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection (set, list, or similar)
- Size()
Returns the total number of nodes in the graph
