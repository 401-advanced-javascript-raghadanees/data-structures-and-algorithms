## leftJoin
### Implement a simplified LEFT JOIN for 2 Hashmaps.

### Challenge
Write a function called leftJoin ==> Implement a simplified LEFT JOIN for 2 Hashmaps
 LEFT JOIN means all the values in the first hashmap are returned, and if values exist in the “right” hashmap, they are appended to the result row. If no values exist in the right hashmap, then some flavor of NULL should be appended to the result row

## Big O:
Time O(n) 
space O(n)
