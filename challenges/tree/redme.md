## Challenge Summary
make binary tree class and BST

## Challenge Description
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node. 
Create a BinaryTree class Define a method for each of the depth first traversals called preOrder, inOrder, and postOrder which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately. 

Create a BinarySearchTree class Define a method named add that accepts a value, and adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree. Define a method named contains that accepts a value, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.

Approach & Efficiency
print the binary tree contain in three method apply BST concept with add and search

it is efficient to search about number it will reduce the big o for time from o(n) to log (n)

Solution
